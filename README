This repository is just a dumping place for me to put various scripts
and tools I've written to help me perform penetration testing and
vulnerability scanning. 

My main goal is to put code I find useful someplace other than on
my own gear, since I tend to rebuild frequently, and suck at making
sure I've kept all my crap so that I have it after I'm done.

Questions/Comments/Tips/Requests are welcome and can be sent to me
